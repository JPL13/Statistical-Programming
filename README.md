2.Homewrok2-Metropolis algorithm, Gibbs sampling.\
3.Homework3-Sweep operator, Linear Model based on Sweep operator.\
4.Homework4-QR decomposition, Linear model based on QR.\
5.Homework5-Eigen computation, Principal Component Analysis.\
6.Homework6-Logistic regression, Adaboost.\
7.Homework7-XGboost.\
8.Homework8-SVM.\
9.Final Project-Lasso solution path, Neural Networks.
